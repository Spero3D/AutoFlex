Before starting, check the Compatibility and Adaptability to see if your 3D printer is listed among the Adapted Printers.

## Required Materials and Equipment

1. **Spring Steel Sheet Metal**

   - **Thickness:** 0.008" (0.2 mm)
   - **Size:**
     - For Creality Ender-3 Pro: 9.2" \* 10.6" (23.5 cm x 27 cm)
     - For Artillery Sidewinder X1: 12" \* 14.2" (31 cm x 36 cm)
   - For Non-Adapted 3D Printers Recommended Adaptation Steps:
     1. Measure your 3D printer bed sizes.
     2. Add 1.5"(4 cm) to the original y dimension size of your plate to account for extra space at the back.
     3. Get a metal sheet in dimensions x x (y + 4 cm).

2. **Single Track Rail (Ceiling Curtain Track can be used)**

   - **Size:** Same as the x dimension of your 3D printer bed.
     - For Creality Ender 3 Pro: 9.2" (23.5 cm)
     - For Artillery Sidewinder X1: 12" (31 cm)

3. **Kapton Tape**

4. **Two-Sided Mounting Tape**

5. **Any Kind of Fastening Tape** (This could be Blue 3M Tape, Sealing Tape, or Duct Tape.)

6. **Magnetic Sheet**

   - **Size:** Same as the 3D Printer bed measures

7. **Hand/Power Saw** (To cut the rail)

8. **Scissor** (8" Multipurpose scissors would be fine.)

9. **Soap and Water**

10. **Sponge**

11. **Scraper**

## Preparing Materials

### Metal Sheet

Tip: You can cut the 0.2 mm metal sheet with a sharp office scissor.

### Rail

An aluminum or plastic ceiling curtain track can be used. Aluminum rails are recommended due to their strength and resistance to stress. In order to create an open gap that the adapter docks before going in, the rail should be cut 2" (5 cm) inside from the left or right side.

Tip: Oscillating tools with saw blades work great for cutting and are recommended due to safety reasons.

## Assembly the Items

### Step 1: Cover the Steel Sheet with Kapton Tape

For the easiest and cleanest lamination process with Kapton tape, start by dampening the surface with soapy water to create a smooth application. Then, gently press down on the Kapton tape, using a flexible plastic scraper to ensure proper adhesion without leaving any air bubbles or wrinkles.

### Step 2: Fasten the Rail to the Metal Sheet

Use two-sided mounting tape to securely fasten the rail to the back short side of the metal sheet.

### Step 3: Plaster the Magnetic Sheet with Adhesive Back

Prepare the 3D printer bed by plastering and covering it with the magnetic sheet featuring an adhesive back. This step ensures proper adhesion and compatibility with your Spero Autoflex printing plate.

### Step 4: Mount the Spero Autoflex Building Plate to the 3D Printer Bed

Align the metal sheet and the 3D printer bed at the front side, allowing the Spero Autoflex printing plate to extend beyond the bed from the rear. Secure the plate by taping it to the front of the 3D printer bed with duct tape. Then secure the bed and the table by taping them from the inside with blue 3M tape. Make sure the table is firmly attached to the bed and opens and closes smoothly.

Congratulations! Your Spero Autoflex Printing Plate is now ready for use, providing you with seamless and efficient 3D printing capabilities.

# Adapter

The Spero Autoflex Adapter plays a crucial role in the mechanism, acting as a hook that inserts into the rail and effortlessly raises the Spero Autoflex Printing Plate.

## Pathway for the 3D Printers Adapted Before

If your 3D printer is adapted before (you can check from [here](#)), you can follow these steps:

### Step 1 - Download the 3D design of adapter

Download the design of the adapter customized for your 3D printer from [here](#).

### Step 2 - Print the adapter

After slicing the design, print the adapter with a 3D printer. You can use PLA, PLA+, ABS, ASA, PETG filaments for printing.

### Step 3 - Screw in the Bolt

Please provide an M10 bolt with a height between 10 mm and 22 mm, depending on the adapter you use. Screw the bolt into the adapter body, which was previously printed, from the hole below.

**Tip:** You can round off the bolt's head with a file so that it can easily fit into the rail. Do not screw the bolt too deeply; the height of the bolt must be higher than the nozzle to avoid damaging the print.

### Step 4 - Mount to the Extruder

Mount the adapter to the 3D printer extruder using the screws at the predetermined points.

### Step 5 - Test the functionality

Make sure that the bolt can enter to the rail and exit smoothly.

**Tip:** Apply some grease to the head of the bolt and the rail to ensure the bolt enters the rail smoothly.

## Pathway for the 3D Printers Not Adapted Yet

### Step 1 - Explore the Extruder

Explore your 3D Printer's extruder by dismantling. Pay attention to the anchors.

### Step 2 - Discover the Potential Anchors

Identify the potential anchor points, such as screw holes, indentations, and bulges, for installing the adapter to be designed.

### Step 3 - Measure

Take detailed and precise measurements of the extruder and the potential mounting structure.

### Step 4 - Determine Anchors

You can utilize the screw holes, indentations, and bulges.

**Tip:** Alter current screws with longer ones to install the adapter.

### Step 5 - Design the New Adapter

Model the newly customized adapter for your 3D Printer in a 3D modeling program (Autodesk Fusion 360, Onshape, Blender, TinkerCad, etc.)

**Important Considerations:**

- The head of the bolt should be higher than the nozzle so that the print is not damaged.
- Make sure that the default capabilities of the 3D printer are not interfered by the adapter.
- Pay attention that the adapter does not touch the right/left switches.

Afterward, return to the previously adapted 3D printer pathway, located at the top of the page, and install the adapter.

# Bed Clearing Code

The bed clearing code is the final script that initiates the movement to remove the printed part from the bed. Let's dive in!

The Spero Bed Clearing Code comprises specialized G-code commands designed to facilitate the seamless removal of printed parts from the Spero Autoflex Printing Plate, safely guiding them to the front for easy retrieval. This code is executed after the completion of printing, ensuring efficient part removal.

## Connecting with 3D Printer

You can either download the bed clearing code if your 3D printer is among the previously adapted models or create it yourself. In either case, it's important to test the script before using it. Small differences in the mechanics and software of your 3D printer may require fine-tuning the bed clearing code. To do this, you first need to establish a connection that allows you to send G-code commands directly to your 3D printer.

There are several ways to connect with your 3D printer:

### Octoprint & Cura Slicer

If you installed Octoprint to your 3D Printer, you can connect via Cura slicer and send G-code. There is a detailed explanation in the video below:

### Octoprint & Gcodebar Plugin

Octoprint is a free and open-source software providing a useful interface to manage 3D Printers. Install Octoprint on your 3D Printer ([Download Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/download/)).

### Repetier Host

[Repetier Host](https://www.repetier.com/)

### Universal Gcode Sender

[Universal Gcode Sender](https://universalgcodesender.com/)

## Learn Commonly Used G-codes

- **G90** - Absolute positioning - Set all positions and movement in the logical coordinate space
- **G91** - Relative positioning - Interprets all positions relative to the last position
- **G1** / **G0** - Linear movement. For example:
  - `G1 Z200` —> Extruder moves to 200 mm in Z-axis of the coordinate system
  - `G0 X10 Y30` —> Extruder and printing plate move to 10 mm in X-axis and 30 mm in Y-axis of the coordinate system
- **G28** - Home the axis. For example:
  - `G28 X Y` —> Homing only X and Y axes
  - `G28` —> Homing all axes
- **M211** - Disable software endstops

## Pathway for Non-Adapted 3D Printers

If your 3D printer is not adapted yet, you can easily create a Bed Clearing Code customized for your 3D Printer. You can also contribute to this innovation by sharing this new adaptation with us and others! Upload your adaptation to the GitHub repository of Autoflex!

Before we dive in, let's see how to create a Bed Clearing Code.

Spero Bed Clearing Code may require adjustment based on factors such as the size of the 3D printer bed, the quality of the material used in the plate, or the geometry of the printed parts. Our goal is to explain the structure and logic behind the Spero Bed Clearing Code, empowering you to adapt it to your specific 3D printer and requirements.

### Structure of Bed Clearing Code

1. **Presets and Positioning**

   Before initiating extruder and Spero Autoflex movements, it's essential to ensure that the extruder is positioned correctly and that the 3D printer interprets commands as positions in the logical coordinate space, rather than relative to the previous location. Additionally, you can configure parameters such as extruder movement speed and warning sounds. The Presets and Positioning section of recommended Bed Clearing Code for Creality Ender-3 Pro is like this:

   ```gcode
   M211 S0 ;Disable software endstops
   G91 ;Positioning relatively
   G1 Z20 ;Move Z-axis 20mm higher
   G28 X Y ;Home X and Y axes
   G90 ;Positioning absolutely
   ```

2. **Docking**

   Once the preset and positioning phase is complete, the extruder needs to be moved above the rail to facilitate connection with the Spero Autoflex Adapter. It's crucial to ensure that the bolt can easily enter the rail through the open gap, allowing for a seamless docking process. Pay close attention to alignment and positioning to ensure a smooth connection between the extruder and the rail. The Docking section of recommended Bed Clearing Code for Creality Ender-3 Pro is like this:

   ```gcode
   G1 X230 Y230 ;Go to the upper-right corner 230 mm
   G1 Z10 ;Docking the adapter by moving Z-axis 20mm lower
   G1 X150 ;Adapter goes into the rail
   ```

3. **Clearing**

   During this stage, the Spero Autoflex Printing Plate ascends and executes various movements to ensure the secure removal of printed parts from the surface.

   3.1. **Lifting Up**

   Spero Autoflex Printing Plate elevates, preparing to disengage the printed parts from the surface. The Lifting Up section of recommended Bed Clearing Code for Creality Ender-3 Pro is like this:

   ```gcode
   G1 Z30 ;Lift up the plate
   ```

   3.2. **Bending In and/or Out**

   Spero Autoflex Printing Plate may perform bending movements as necessary to facilitate the detachment of printed parts. The Bending In and/or Out section of recommended Bed Clearing Code for Creality Ender-3 Pro is like this:

   ```gcode
   G1 Z60 Y215
   G1 Z100 Y185
   G1 Z120 Y170
   G1 Z140 Y120
   G1 Z160 Y170
   G1 Z120 Y60
   ```

   3.3. **Leveling**

   Printed parts are gently slid and removed from the plate, ensuring a smooth and controlled extraction process. The Leveling section of recommended Bed Clearing Code for Creality Ender-3 Pro is like this:

   ```gcode
   G1 Z200 Y100
   G1 Z220 Y50
   ```

4. **Recovery**

   In the recovery phase, both the Spero Autoflex Printing Plate and the extruder return to their initial positions. This prepares the 3D printer for the next printing task, ensuring it is ready to proceed without delay. The Recovery section of recommended Bed Clearing Code for Creality Ender-3 Pro is like this:

   ```gcode
   G1 Z60 Y215 ;Recovery
   G1 Z30 Y230
   G1 Z7
   G1 X230 ;Adapter exits from the rail
   G1 Z50 ;Move up the Z-axis

   G28 ;Home all axes
   M211 S1 ;Enable software endstops
   ```

5. **Wiping (Optional)**

   If desired, you can add a wiping section to ensure that the parts are removed from the bed by pushing them with the extruder head. The Wiping section of recommended Bed Clearing Code for Creality Ender-3 Pro is like this:

   ```gcode
   G1 Y205 ;Position for wiping
   G1 X160 Z2
   G1 Y5 ;Wipe right section
   G1 Z50 Y205 X110
   G1 Z2
   G1 Y5 ;Wipe middle section
   G1 Z50 Y205 X70
   G1 Z2
   G1 Y5 ;Wipe left section
   ```
